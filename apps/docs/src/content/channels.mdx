# Channels

AgentTeams supports Telegram, WhatsApp, and embeddable Webchat.

## Telegram Setup

1. Create bot credentials via `@BotFather`.
2. Add token in `Settings -> Channels -> Telegram`.
3. Configure webhook endpoint and verify delivery.
4. Map bot to a workflow or agent handoff rule.

## WhatsApp Setup

1. Connect your WhatsApp Business API provider.
2. Register phone number and webhook callbacks.
3. Add credentials in `Settings -> Channels -> WhatsApp`.
4. Define message templates and compliance defaults.

## Webchat Embed

Use the embed snippet in your site/app shell:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.agentteams.dev/webchat.js" defer></script>
<div id="agentteams-webchat" data-workspace="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"></div>
```

### Recommended Practices

- Route each channel to a specific workflow entrypoint.
- Keep channel-specific prompts for tone and response length.
- Enable usage tracking per channel for cost visibility.
