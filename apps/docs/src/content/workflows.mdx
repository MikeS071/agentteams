# Workflows

Workflows provide guided, repeatable execution paths.

## Guided Templates

Templates encode:

- Trigger conditions
- Input schema and validation
- Step-by-step agent orchestration
- Output contracts

Typical templates include onboarding assistants, support escalations, and lead qualification.

## Create Custom Workflows

1. Open `Dashboard -> Workflows -> New Workflow`.
2. Select a template baseline or start empty.
3. Define triggers (`manual`, `webhook`, `channel message`).
4. Add agent steps with explicit success criteria.
5. Configure retries, timeout, and fallback branches.
6. Publish and run test executions.

## Operating Model

- Version workflows before major prompt or logic updates.
- Promote from staging to production after evaluation runs.
- Track token usage and latency per workflow step.
