# Billing

Billing combines plans, credits, and usage tracking.

## Plans

Plans define included credits, limits, and support tier.

- Starter: lower volume, fast onboarding
- Growth: higher throughput and channel expansion
- Enterprise: advanced controls and custom limits

## Credits and Usage

Track spend by:

- Agent runs
- Model tokens
- Channel traffic
- Deployment activity

Use `Dashboard -> Billing` and `Dashboard -> Usage` for detailed breakdowns.

## Stripe Integration

Stripe powers checkout, subscription lifecycle, and invoice history.

- Upgrade/downgrade plans
- View balance and payment history
- Track current period usage against limits
