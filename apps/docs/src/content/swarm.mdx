# Swarm

Swarm enables multi-agent coordination with a central coordinator and specialist sub-agents.

## How Coordination Works

1. Coordinator receives task objective and constraints.
2. Task is decomposed into parallel or sequential work packets.
3. Sub-agents execute scoped packets with specific tools.
4. Coordinator aggregates outputs and resolves conflicts.
5. Final response is validated before return.

## Monitoring Dashboard

Use `Dashboard -> Swarm` to inspect:

- Active runs and queue depth
- Agent-level latency and token usage
- Failure points and retry traces
- Final merge confidence signals

## Reliability Controls

- Max parallel agent cap
- Circuit breaker for repeated step failures
- Human approval checkpoints on high-impact actions
