# AS-10: Clip Creator — Chat + Media panel

## Scope
When "Clip Creator" agent is active, layout splits 50/50:
- Left: Chat UI
- Right: Media panel

## Media Panel component
Create `apps/web/src/components/MediaPanel.tsx`:

### Sections:
1. **Preview Area** — large area for video/image preview
   - Supports: image preview, video player (HTML5 video), before/after comparison
2. **Timeline/Storyboard** — horizontal strip of thumbnail frames
   - Click frame to seek/preview
   - Drag handles for trim start/end
3. **Export Options** — format selector (MP4, GIF, WebM), quality, dimensions
4. **Clip Library** — grid of previously created clips with thumbnails

### Data flow
- Parse assistant messages for media URLs and clip metadata
- Preview renders media as it's generated

## Styling
- Preview: centered, max-height, dark background with subtle border
- Timeline: horizontal scroll, thumbnail strip

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-10`
- Commit: `feat: Clip Creator split UI with media panel`
- Verify build passes
