# AS-05: Agent panel move to top full height

## Scope
Move the agent grid panel to occupy the top of the layout at full viewport height when no agent mode is active (the "home" state).

## Current behavior
The agent grid is a panel within the chat page, possibly sharing space with conversation sidebar.

## New behavior
- When no agent is selected (home state): agent grid fills the full content area
- Grid shows all agent tiles in a centered, visually prominent layout
- Each tile has: icon/image, name, description, "Start" button
- When an agent is selected: grid collapses to the compact selector (from as-04)

## Implementation
In `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`:
- When `activeMode === null`: render `<AgentGrid>` as full-page hero
- When `activeMode !== null`: render compact selector + agent mode layout

## Styling
- Full-page agent grid: centered, max-width container, larger tiles (min 200px each)
- Dark theme consistent with existing: bg-[#0a0a0f], border-[#24242c]
- Add a subtle heading: "Choose an AI Agent to get started"

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-05`
- Commit: `feat: agent panel full height home state`
- Verify build passes
