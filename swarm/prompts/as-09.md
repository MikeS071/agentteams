# AS-09: Social Manager — Chat + Calendar/ContentAI panel

## Scope
When "Social Manager" agent is active, layout splits 50/50:
- Left: Chat UI
- Right: Social Calendar panel

## Social Panel component
Create `apps/web/src/components/SocialPanel.tsx`:

### Sections:
1. **Content Pipeline** — list of content items with status:
   - Draft → QA → Approved → Published → Scheduled
   - Each item: title, platform badges (X, LinkedIn), status badge
2. **Posting Calendar** — week view grid:
   - Mon-Fri columns, time slots
   - Scheduled posts shown as colored blocks
   - Click to view/edit post details
3. **Social Accounts** — connected accounts with status indicators
4. **Quick Actions** — buttons: "Draft Post", "Schedule", "View Analytics"

### Data flow
- Parse assistant messages for content/scheduling data
- Calendar renders from structured schedule data

## Styling
- Calendar: grid layout, dark cells, colored post blocks by platform
- X = blue accent, LinkedIn = indigo accent

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-09`
- Commit: `feat: Social Manager split UI with calendar panel`
- Verify build passes
