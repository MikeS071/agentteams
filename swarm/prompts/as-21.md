# AS-21: Move Configure + New Chat buttons to chat header bar

## Scope
Move the "Configure" button (agent config/setup) and "+ New Chat" button into the chat header bar, next to the agent name/active indicator.

## File: `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`

### Chat header layout (left to right):
```
[Agent Icon + Name (green active)] [Configure ⚙️] [+ New Chat] [... spacer ...] [Model Dropdown (from as-22)]
```

- "Configure" opens the existing AgentSetup wizard/modal
- "+ New Chat" clears conversation and starts fresh
- Both buttons: small, ghost style (border-[#24242c], hover:bg-[#131320])
- Remove these buttons from wherever they currently are (sidebar, bottom, etc.)

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-21`
- Commit: `feat: move Configure + New Chat to chat header`
- Verify build
