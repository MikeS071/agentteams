# AS-27: Coder quick actions — Project + Web Page modals with swarm prompt

## File: `apps/web/src/lib/quick-actions.ts`

Add to `QUICK_ACTIONS.coder`:

### 1. "Project" action
```typescript
{
  id: "new-project",
  label: "Project",
  icon: "📦",
  fields: [
    { id: "project_name", label: "Project Name", placeholder: "e.g. my-api-service", type: "text", required: true },
    { id: "project_type", label: "Type", placeholder: "What kind?", type: "select", required: true, options: ["SKILL", "FEATURE", "WEBAPP", "LANDING_PAGE", "CLI_TOOL", "API_SERVICE", "LIBRARY"] },
    { id: "goal", label: "Goal", placeholder: "e.g. Build a REST API for user management", type: "textarea", required: true },
    { id: "description", label: "Description", placeholder: "Detailed description of what you want built", type: "textarea", required: true },
    { id: "requirements", label: "Requirements", placeholder: "e.g. Must support JWT auth, PostgreSQL, rate limiting", type: "textarea", required: false },
  ],
  promptTemplate: `Spec out a new project {{project_name}} which we'll build using agent-swarm. This is a new {{project_type}}.
Requirements are:
GOAL: {{goal}}
DESCRIPTION: {{description}}
REQUIREMENTS: {{requirements}}
INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a new project directory, create the spec, ask me any clarifying questions one-by-one to improve the spec and remove ambiguous areas. Be detailed and present examples for me to decide on design options or direction.
Once a spec is done, ask me to approve to proceed to create a detailed execution plan, and then break this down into small 5-10min tickets that can be built by the swarm agents. Register the project/tickets into the swarm project/register.
Ensure each ticket/agent follow TDD principles (create failing tests matching functional specs, then build, then test, then break-fix). Include a ticket to, once all tickets are built, to merge all branches before a final audit and integration tests are run.
{{#project_type_is_skill}}For SKILL projects: use go cli as implementation. Include SKILL.MD and splice appropriate instructions into MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md and AGENTS.md so they can be appended to a new OpenClaw instance environment.{{/project_type_is_skill}}
Include at the end:
- Merge of all the worktrees/branches and resolve conflicts
- Execute End to end comprehensive integration and functional test suite
- Update all relevant user and technical doco

Lastly, ask me to approve to proceed to build.`
}
```

```typescript
{

    { id: "requirements", label: "Requirements", placeholder: "e.g. Responsive, dark theme, animations", type: "textarea", required: false },
