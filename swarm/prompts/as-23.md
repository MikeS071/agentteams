# AS-23: Remove model label from chat bottom bar

## File: `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`

Find and remove the `activeModelLabel` display from the chat bottom/input bar area. The model is now shown in the chat header (as-22), so showing it again at the bottom is redundant.

Search for `activeModelLabel` references in the JSX around lines 880-890 and remove the element displaying it in the bottom bar. Keep the `activeModelLabel` variable itself (used by the header).
