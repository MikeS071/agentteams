# AS-26: Research Assistant quick action — Start New Research modal

## File: `apps/web/src/lib/quick-actions.ts`

Add to `QUICK_ACTIONS.research`:

```typescript
{
  id: "start-research",
  label: "Start New Research",
  icon: "🔬",
  fields: [
    { id: "question", label: "Research Question", placeholder: "e.g. What are the most effective AI agent frameworks for production use in 2026?", type: "textarea", required: true },
    { id: "description", label: "Description / Context", placeholder: "e.g. Focus on frameworks that support multi-agent coordination, tool use, and memory", type: "textarea", required: false },
    { id: "depth", label: "Depth", placeholder: "How deep?", type: "select", required: false, options: ["Quick brief (500-800 words)", "Standard report (1500-2500 words)", "Deep dive (3000-5000 words)", "Comprehensive (no word limit)"] },
    { id: "audience", label: "Target Audience", placeholder: "e.g. Technical leadership, engineering team", type: "text", required: false },
    { id: "sources", label: "Source Priorities", placeholder: "e.g. Prefer peer-reviewed papers over blog posts", type: "text", required: false },
  ],
  promptTemplate: `Research the following topic thoroughly and produce a comprehensive report.

**Research Question:** {{question}}
{{#description}}
**Context:** {{description}}
{{/description}}
{{#depth}}
**Depth:** {{depth}}
{{/depth}}
{{#audience}}
**Target Audience:** {{audience}}
{{/audience}}
{{#sources}}
**Source Priorities:** {{sources}}
{{/sources}}

Follow your research methodology: decompose into sub-questions, search multiple source types, triangulate findings, identify gaps, and synthesize into a structured report with citations.`
}
```

Note: The `{{#field}}...{{/field}}` conditional blocks should only be included if the field has a value. Implement simple template replacement in the QuickActionModal submit handler — if a field is empty, remove the whole conditional block.
