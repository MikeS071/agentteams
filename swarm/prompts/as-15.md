# AS-15: Remove Hands dashboard page and nav entry

## Scope
Remove the entire Hands section from the dashboard.

## Changes
1. **Delete** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/hands/` directory (page.tsx + [id]/page.tsx)
2. **Remove nav entry** in `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — delete the item `{ href: "/dashboard/hands", label: "Hands" }` (or "AI Agents" if as-01 already renamed it)
3. **Remove API routes** — delete `apps/web/src/app/api/hands/` directory if it exists
4. **Remove lib** — delete `apps/web/src/lib/hands.ts` (or `ai-agents.ts` if already renamed by as-01)
5. **Clean imports** — grep for any remaining imports of hands/ai-agents lib and remove dead references

The agent functionality now lives entirely in the Chat page via agent mode selection (as-04).

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-15`
