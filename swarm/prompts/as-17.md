# AS-17: Integration merge — merge all feature branches into main

## Scope
Merge ALL completed feature branches into main in dependency order, resolving any conflicts.

## Process
1. Start from latest main: `git checkout main && git pull`
2. Merge Phase 1 branches first (no deps between them):
   - `git merge feat/as-01 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-02 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-03 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-13 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-14 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-15 --no-ff`
3. Merge Phase 2:
   - `git merge feat/as-04 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-05 --no-ff`
   - `git merge feat/as-16 --no-ff`
4. Merge Phase 3:
   - `git merge feat/as-06 --no-ff` through `feat/as-11 --no-ff`
5. Resolve conflicts at each step — keep the most recent intent, never drop functional code
6. After all merges: `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit && npx next build`
7. Fix any build errors from merge conflicts

## Conflict resolution priority
- If two branches modify the same component: combine both changes
- If a branch removes code another branch modifies: the removal wins (it was intentional cleanup)
- Agent list changes: final list should be exactly 6 agents (chat, research, coder, intel, social, clip)

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-17` (create from main, merge all into it, then PR to main)
- Commit: `feat: integration merge — all 16 feature branches consolidated`
- Build MUST pass before marking done
