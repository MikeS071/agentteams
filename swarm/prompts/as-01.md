# AS-01: Rename OpenFang Hands to AI Agents everywhere

## Scope
Find and replace ALL references to "Hands" / "OpenFang Hands" / "hands" with "AI Agents" across the entire `apps/web/` directory.

## Changes required

1. **`apps/web/src/components/AgentGrid.tsx`** — Change header text from "OpenFang Hands" to "AI Agents"
2. **`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`** — Change nav item `{ href: "/dashboard/hands", label: "Hands" }` to `{ href: "/dashboard/agents", label: "AI Agents" }` (or rename the existing "Agents" link if there's a conflict — merge the two concepts)
3. **`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/hands/` directory** — Rename to `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/ai-agents/` (or merge into existing `agents/` page if it exists)
4. **`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/hands/[id]/page.tsx`** — Move to new path, update all imports
5. **`apps/web/src/lib/hands.ts`** — Rename to `apps/web/src/lib/ai-agents.ts`, update type names: `HandSummary` → `AgentSummary`, etc.
6. **All API routes** — `apps/web/src/app/api/hands/` rename to `apps/web/src/app/api/ai-agents/` and update all fetch URLs
7. **Any other file** referencing "hands" or "Hands" — do a project-wide `grep -r "hands\|Hands\|HANDS" apps/web/src/` and fix every occurrence

## Rules
- Do NOT change `node_modules` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Keep backward compatibility: if there are API consumers, add redirect from old paths
- Branch: `feat/as-01`
- Commit: `refactor: rename OpenFang Hands to AI Agents`
- Run `cd apps/web && npx next build` or `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no broken imports
