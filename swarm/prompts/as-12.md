# AS-12: Integration pass — verify all agent modes + responsive

## Scope
Verify all agent modes work correctly and fix any integration issues.

## Checks
1. Each agent mode renders correctly when selected
2. Switching between agents preserves chat history
3. "+ New Chat" button works in all modes
4. Agent mode selector (compact strip) correctly highlights active agent
5. Back to agent grid works
6. All split-panel modes resize correctly at different viewport widths
7. Mobile: side panels stack below chat on screens < 768px
8. No TypeScript errors: `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit`
9. Build succeeds: `cd apps/web && npx next build`
10. No references to "Hands", "OpenFang Hands", "leadgen", or "browser" remain

## Fix anything broken. This is the quality gate.

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-12`
- Commit: `fix: integration pass — all agent modes verified`
