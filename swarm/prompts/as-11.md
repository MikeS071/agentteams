# AS-11: General Chat — standard Chat UI

## Scope
When "General Chat" agent is active, render the full-width standard Chat UI (same as Coder).

## Implementation
- Use AgentModeLayout with no `sidePanel` → full width chat
- This is identical to the Coder mode layout, just with the General Chat system prompt

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-11`
- Commit: `feat: General Chat standard UI mode`
- Verify build passes
