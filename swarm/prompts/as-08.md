# AS-08: Intelligence Collector — Chat + Intel panel

## Scope
When "Intelligence Collector" agent is active, layout splits 50/50:
- Left: Chat UI
- Right: Intel Dashboard panel

## Intel Panel component
Create `apps/web/src/components/IntelPanel.tsx`:

### Sections:
1. **Monitoring Target** — shows current target name + type (company/person/topic)
2. **Intel Feed** — reverse-chronological list of findings:
   - Each entry: timestamp, category badge (product/hiring/funding/tech), title, snippet
   - Source URL link
3. **Key Signals** — highlighted important findings with severity (🔴 high / 🟡 medium / 🟢 low)
4. **Timeline** — simple date-based grouping of intel entries

### Data flow
- Parse assistant chat messages for structured intel data
- Display findings as they arrive in the feed

## Styling
- Dark theme consistent with rest of app
- Feed items: compact cards with left border color by category

## Rules
- Branch: `feat/as-08`
- Commit: `feat: Intelligence Collector split UI with intel panel`
- Verify build passes
