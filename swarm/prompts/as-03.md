# AS-03: Remove Conversations sidebar + move New button

## Scope
Remove the Conversations panel from the chat page sidebar and move the "+ New" button into the chat pane header.

## File: `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`

### Remove
- The `conversations` state, `loadConversations` callback, and all conversation list rendering
- The sidebar panel that shows conversation history (the left panel with conversation list)
- The `sidebarOpen` state and toggle button
- Any `<aside>` or sidebar container showing conversations

### Add
- A "+ New Chat" button in the top header of the chat pane (next to the agent name/model selector)
- The button should call the existing `startNewConversation` logic (clear messages, reset conversationId)

### Layout change
- The chat page should now be: Agent grid (top or side) + Chat pane (main area)
- No more conversation list sidebar
- The agent grid panel should take up the available space where the conversation sidebar was

## Rules
- Keep the conversation API endpoints (they're still used for chat history internally)
- Just remove the UI listing conversations
- Branch: `feat/as-03`
- Commit: `refactor: remove conversations sidebar, move New button to chat header`
- Verify: `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit`
