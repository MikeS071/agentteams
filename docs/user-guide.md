# User Guide

## Overview
The refactored dashboard is built around six agents, a chat-first workflow, and a split-layout workspace with contextual side panels.

## Agent Selection
Use the agent selector in chat to choose the assistant that best matches your task.

| Agent | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| General Chat | Fast Q&A, brainstorming, general conversation |
| Research Assistant | Deep research with structured synthesis |
| Coder | Building and debugging software workflows |
| Intelligence Collector | Monitoring signals, changes, and competitive intel |
| Social Manager | Social content drafts and campaign planning |
| Clip Creator | Turning long-form video into short clip ideas |

## Agent Modes (Split Layout)
Each agent mode uses the same core structure: `ChatPanel` on the left and a contextual `SidePanel` on the right.

| Agent mode | Left panel | Right panel (context) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Chat | Conversation thread + input | Lightweight context/actions panel |
| Research Assistant | Research conversation | Sources, notes, and synthesis context |
| Coder | Build/debug conversation | Task status, artifacts, and execution context |
| Intelligence Collector | Intel brief conversation | Signals timeline and tracked entities |
| Social Manager | Drafting conversation | Draft queue and publishing context |
| Clip Creator | Clip-planning conversation | Clip candidates, timestamps, and notes |

## Chat Workflow
### Start a New Chat
1. Open the chat view.
2. Click `New Chat`.
3. Pick an agent.
4. Send your first prompt.

### Switch Agents
1. Open the agent selector.
2. Choose a different agent.
3. Continue in the current thread or start a new chat for a clean context.

## Swarm Monitoring
Swarm monitoring appears in two places:

1. `Collapsible chat panel`: compact swarm status while you are in chat.
2. `Swarm tab`: full-screen monitoring for task list, details, and live events.

Use the compact panel for quick checks and the Swarm tab for deeper triage.

## Sidebar Icon Navigation
The sidebar uses icon-based navigation to move between major dashboard areas quickly:

1. Chat
2. Agents
3. Swarm
4. Channels
5. Usage/Billing
6. Settings/Profile

Icons are persistent across pages so you can switch contexts without leaving the dashboard shell.
