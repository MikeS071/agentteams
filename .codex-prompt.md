# OF-27: User Onboarding Wizard
## Objective
Guided onboarding flow for new users: choose agents, configure first Hand, send first message.
## Working Directory
`/home/openclaw/projects/agentteams/apps/web/`
## Tasks
1. Create `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` — multi-step wizard:
   - Step 1: Welcome + "What do you want to build?" (select use case: research, coding, marketing, general)
   - Step 2: Recommended agents highlighted based on use case, user picks 1-3 to enable
   - Step 3: Quick config for primary agent (name it, pick model, set brief system prompt)
   - Step 4: Send first test message to the configured agent
   - Step 5: Success! "Your agent is ready" → redirect to dashboard
2. Progress indicator (step dots or progress bar)
3. Skip button on each step
4. Store onboarding completion in user profile (don't show again)
5. Redirect new users to `/onboarding` on first login (check flag in session)
6. Match dark theme, smooth transitions between steps
## Verification
- `npx next build` succeeds
- Wizard renders all 5 steps
## CRITICAL — You MUST commit and push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(web): user onboarding wizard"
