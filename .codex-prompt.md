# OF-15: Hand Dashboard & Metrics
## Objective
Per-Hand dashboard showing conversation history, tool usage metrics, and performance stats.
## Working Directory
`/home/openclaw/projects/agentteams/apps/web/`
## Tasks
1. Create `src/app/dashboard/hands/[id]/page.tsx` — individual Hand view:
   - Hand name, description, status, model being used
   - Conversation history list (last 20 conversations, click to view)
   - Tool usage: which tools this Hand uses most, success/failure rates
   - Token usage: daily chart for this Hand
   - Config panel: edit system prompt, model, enabled tools (calls Go API PUT /api/hands/:id)
2. Create `src/app/dashboard/hands/page.tsx` — overview of all Hands:
   - Grid/list of all 8 agents with status badges
   - Quick stats: total conversations, tokens used today
   - Enable/disable toggle per Hand
3. Fetch from Go API: `GET /api/hands`, `GET /api/hands/:id`, `GET /api/hands/:id/history`
4. Match dark theme
## Verification
- `npx next build` succeeds
