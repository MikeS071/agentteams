# OF-22: Landing Page Audit
## Objective
Final audit: verify every landing page claim maps to a real, working feature. Fix any gaps.
## Working Directory
`/home/openclaw/projects/agentteams/apps/web/`
## Tasks
1. Read the landing page (`src/app/page.tsx` or public landing)
2. For each claim/feature mentioned, verify the corresponding page/API exists:
   - Agent grid → `/dashboard` with agent tiles
   - Chat → `/dashboard` chat interface
   - Pricing → `/pricing`
   - Docs → `/docs`
   - Billing → `/dashboard/billing`
   - Admin → `/admin`
   - Channels (Telegram/WhatsApp) → `/dashboard/channels`
   - Agent swarm → `/dashboard/swarm`
   - Deploy (Vercel/Supabase) → `/dashboard/deploy`
   - Onboarding → `/onboarding`
3. Fix any broken links
4. Remove or update any claims that don't match reality
5. Ensure all CTA buttons work (signup, login, pricing)
6. Verify responsive design (mobile + desktop)
7. Check meta tags: title, description, og:image
## Verification
- `npx next build` succeeds
- All internal links resolve to existing pages
- No "Coming Soon" badges for features that exist
## CRITICAL — You MUST commit and push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(landing): audit all claims against real features"
git push origin feat/of-22
```
Do NOT exit without committing and pushing.
