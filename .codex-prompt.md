# OF-11: Pricing Page
## Objective
Build a public pricing page showing credit packages and feature comparison.
## Working Directory
`/home/openclaw/projects/agentteams/apps/web/`
## Tasks
1. Create `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` — responsive pricing page with 3 tiers:
   - Free: 1M tokens, 1 agent, basic tools
   - Pro ($25/mo): 5M tokens, all agents, all tools, priority
   - Enterprise: custom, contact us
2. Credit package cards (one-time): $10/1M, $25/3M, $50/7M tokens
3. Feature comparison table (agents, tools, support, channels)
4. CTA buttons → `/signup` for free, Stripe checkout for paid
5. Match dark theme from OF-19 (Apple terminal aesthetic)
6. Mobile responsive
## Verification
- `npx next build` succeeds
- `/pricing` renders correctly
## CRITICAL — You MUST commit and push
