# OF-10: Landing Page Fixes

## Objective
Update the AgentSquads landing page to add navigation links, fix signup, and ensure every claim maps to a real feature.

## Working Directory
`/home/openclaw/projects/agentteams/apps/web/`

## Context
- Landing page is at `src/app/page.tsx` (or the root public page)
- Currently missing: Login link, Pricing link, Docs link in top nav
- `/signup` currently redirects to `/login` — needs its own page
- Agent count should be 8 (7 OpenFang Hands + General Chat)

## Tasks

1. **Top navigation header** — Add to the landing page header:
   - **Login** button (top right) → `/login`
   - **Pricing** link → `/pricing`
   - **Docs** link → `/docs`
   - Style: match existing dark theme, subtle text links + prominent Login button

2. **Fix /signup route**:
   - Create `src/app/signup/page.tsx` if it doesn't exist
   - Should show signup form (email + password + OAuth buttons)
   - NOT redirect to /login
   - "Already have an account? Log in" link at bottom

3. **Update agent count** — Change "8 Pre-built Agents" stat to match reality. Verify all 8 agent cards:
   - Research Assistant, Coder, Lead Generator, Intelligence Collector, Social Manager, Browser Agent, Clip Creator, Predictor
   - Add General Chat if not already listed (as 9th, or keep at 8 if General Chat replaces one)

4. **Verify all claims match real features:**
   - "3 Channels Synced" — Webchat, Telegram, WhatsApp (these will be built in OF-25)
   - "Agent swarm" section — keep as-is (OF-23 will build it)
   - "Pay for what you use" pricing section — keep (OF-05/OF-11 will build billing + pricing page)
   - Vercel + Supabase deploy — keep in feature list (OF-24 will build it)
   - Remove any features that won't be built

5. **Footer** — Add links: Pricing, Docs, Terms, Privacy, Contact

6. **"Get Started Free" CTA buttons** — all should link to `/signup`

## Verification
- Login link visible in header, navigates to `/login`
- Pricing link visible, navigates to `/pricing` (page may 404 until OF-11 builds it — that's OK)
- Docs link visible, navigates to `/docs`
- `/signup` renders a signup page (not redirect)
- All CTA buttons point to `/signup`
- `npx next build` succeeds

## CRITICAL — You MUST commit and push
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(landing): add nav links, fix signup, verify feature claims"
git push origin feat/of-10-landing
```
Do NOT exit without committing and pushing.
